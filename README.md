Okay, let's see. I need to create a README for a GitHub repository that contains various .tf files related to infrastructure as code using Terraform. The goal is to make it professional, concise, and clean. Let me start by understanding what each file does based on their descriptions and content previews.

First, the project title. Since there are multiple files like alb.tf, ec2.tf, etc., maybe the project is about setting up an application load balancer with auto scaling, EBS volumes, etc. But the titles of the files are not very descriptive. For example, alb.tf might be related to the Application Load Balancer. So perhaps the project is a comprehensive Terraform template for building a multi-component infrastructure.

The project title should be something like "Terraform Template for Application Infrastructure" or similar. Wait, looking at the files:

- alb.tf: Possibly part of the setup for the Application Load Balancer.
- autoscaling.tf: Maybe configuring the auto-scaling group.
- ebs.tf: Setting up EBS volumes.
- ec2.tf: User data scripts for EC2 instances.
- main.tf: The main Terraform configuration.
- outputs.tf: Defining output variables like VPC ID and Load Balancer ID.
- security_groups.tf: Configuring security groups.
- terraform.tfvars: Variables like region, project name, key pair.
- variables.tf: Define variables like AWS region.
- vpc.tf: Managing VPCs.

So putting this together, the project likely involves creating a fully automated infrastructure with components like VPC, EC2 instances with EBS storage, Auto Scaling, Load Balancers, and security groups. The purpose would be to automate the setup of a production-like infrastructure using Terraform.

Now, the description. Need to summarize what the project does. It's a collection of Terraform configurations to build a scalable and resilient infrastructure. Each file defines different parts like load balancing, scaling, storage, etc. The project allows setting up these components without manual intervention.

Prerequisites: The main tool here is Terraform. Also, since it uses AWS providers, you need the AWS CDK or just the provider. Wait, noâ€”Terraform uses its own provider for AWS. So the prerequisites are Terraform and having the necessary IAM permissions to create resources. But more precisely, the user needs to have an AWS account with appropriate permissions, and they need to initialize the Terraform backend (like using a TF state stored somewhere). However, looking at the files, some might use a backend like S3 or R53, but most probably assume a local state or a connection to an existing backend. Alternatively, given the presence of tfvars files, maybe the state is stored locally.

Wait, the variables.tf has variables like project_name, which suggests that during initialization, the user sets these variables. So the user needs to know the region, key pair, etc. So the prerequisites would be:

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions.
- Terraform installed locally.
- Set up the variables (like region, key pair) before applying the plan.

But how? Because in the variables.tf, the variables are defined, so when initializing the project, the user runs `terraform init` which requires those variables. So the user needs to define them themselves. Therefore, the prerequisites are Terraform and having the necessary infrastructure (like an existing VPC if vpc_cidr is already set).

Wait, in the vpc.tf, the code creates a new VPC because it uses resource "aws_vpc". So the user doesn't need to have an existing VPC; the code will create one. Similarly, other resources may also be created. But the variables like key pair require the user to provide certain information.

So the prerequisites section can mention that the user needs to have an AWS account, and they need to have the latest version of Terraform installed. Additionally, during the first setup, the user will be prompted to provide values for variables like project name, key name, etc., which are defined in variables.tf and tfvars.

For installation steps, the user clones the repository, installs any necessary dependencies (but since it's all Terraform, the only dependency is the tool itself). Then, they need to initialize the variables. So the steps would involve:

1. Clone the repository into a directory.
2. Create a .tfvars file (based on the existing terraform.tfvars) to store variable values. Or wait, the existing tfvars shows that the variables are set once. Hmm, maybe the project expects the user to use the variables defined in variables.tf and tfvars. But in practice, the variables are set either through environment variables, or in the .tfvars file. So during setup, after cloning, the user should create a .tfvars file with the same keys as the ones in the variables(tf) function. For example, in the sample, the variables are:

variable "aws_region" { ... }
variable "key_name" { ... }

So the user should create a .tfvars file where they assign these variables. Alternatively, since the existing code includes a terraform.tfvars, maybe the project assumes that the user copies that into their project. But I'm not sure. Probably, the correct approach is to have the user create a .tfvars file with the same variables. So the installation steps would include:

- Clone the repository into your local machine.
- Create a .tfvars file containing the variables (like project_name, aws_region, key_name, etc.) as per the defaults provided in variables.tf.
- Run `terraform apply` to create all the resources.

Then, during usage, the user can modify the .tfvars file to change parameters like the number of EC2 instances, adjust the VPC CIDR, etc. They can also add more modules or modify the code in the .tf files to extend the infrastructure.

Examples of usage could be:

Example 1: Deploy the entire infrastructure.

Steps:
1. Copy the existing .tfvars file (from the repository) into your project directory.
2. Update the variables according to your desired settings.
3. Run `terraform apply` to deploy all resources.

Example 2: Modify the number of EC2 instances.

In the ec2.tf file, the number of EC2 instances is hard-coded. To change this, the user can modify the `count` parameter in the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource. For example, changing it from 2 to 4.

After modifying, re-run `terraform apply` to create the new number of instances.

Contributing: The user can send a pull request after making changes. The project accepts contributions, so any code additions are welcome. They should follow the existing code style and ensure that all modules are properly maintained.

The license is MIT. So include the full MIT text.

Putting this all together, the README should cover all these points. Now, writing the actual content.

**Project Title**: 

Probably, the title should be "My Terraform Project" or "Infrastructure as Code Template." Given the files' names, maybe "Application Infrastructure Template" would fit. Alternatively, considering the components, "Full Stack Infrastructure Template" is better.

Wait, the problem says to infer the title from the files' names, purposes, and content. Looking at the files:
