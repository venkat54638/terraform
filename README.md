Okay, let's see. I need to create a README for this GitHub repository. The user provided several files like alb.tf,autoscaling.tf, etc. Let me start by understanding what each of these files do based on their descriptions and content previews.

First, looking at the files:

- **alb.tf** seems related to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) setup with AWS resources.
- **autoscaling.tf** probably handles the auto-scaling group for EC2 instances.
- **ebs.tf** manages EBS volumes, maybe for storing application data.
- **ec2.tf** contains a user data script for configuring EC2 instances.
- **main.tf** is the main Terraform configuration, setting up the infrastructure.
- **outputs.tf** defines output variables like VPC ID and load balancer address.
- **security_groups.tf** sets up security groups for the ALB.
- **terraform.tfvars** holds variables like region and key name.
- **variables.tf** defines variables such as region and project name.
- **vpc.tf** creates the VPC structure.

From all these, it looks like the project is an AWS-based infrastructure setup using Terraform. The main goal is to create a scalable and secure application environment with load balancing, auto-scaling, EBS storage, and other components.

So the project title could be something like "Terraform Configuration for Load Balanced Application with AutoScaling and EBS Storage." That captures the main components observed.

For prerequisites, since it's using Terraform, you need to have the latest version installed along with the AWS provider. Also, having a basic knowledge of Terraform and AWS would help, but maybe that's more about the dependencies during setup.

Installation steps: The user needs to clone the repository, install any necessary dependencies (like ensuring Terraform and providers are set up), then apply the configuration.

Usage examples: Two scenarios might be deploying the entire infrastructure and then accessing the load balancer. For example, one example is deploying the application and another is checking the load balancer's IP.

Contributing involves creating a Pull Request after fork, adding your changes, etc. The license is MIT, so standard terms.

Now, structuring the README:

- Title should be concise but informative.
- Description: 2-3 sentences explaining the project's purpose. It's an automated infrastructure setup using Terraform to manage load balancing, scaling, EBS volumes, etc.
- Prerequisites: Mention that you need Terraform and the AWS provider installed.
- Installation: Steps to clone the repo, set variables, and apply the plan/apply.
- Usage: Examples of commands like `terraform apply` and perhaps querying the load balancer's IP once deployed.
- Contributing: Simple PR guidelines.
- License: Full MIT text.

Let me put this together in markdown. Need to make sure code blocks are properly formatted. Also, ensure that the sections are present and ordered correctly.

# README.md

Here's a structured README for the given GitHub repository:

---

## **Project Title**
Terraform Configuration for Load Balanced Application with AutoScaling and EBS Storage

---

## **Project Overview**
This repository automates the deployment of a production-ready infrastructure using **Terraform**. It sets up an Application Load Balancer (ALB), Auto Scaling Groups for scalability, EBS volumes for data storage, and configures security groups for network traffic. The solution is designed to handle high traffic and scale efficiently.

---

### **Prerequisites**
To set up and run this project, ensure the following are met:
1. **Terraform**: Install the latest version (`>= 1.0`) from [releases](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. ** AWS Provider**: Ensure the `aws` provider is correctly configured and available.
3. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with AWS concepts (VPCs, ALBs, EBS, etc.) helps in understanding the implementation.

---

### **Prerequisites Configuration**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Set environment variables (optional):
   ```bash
   export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   export PROJECT_NAME=my-terraform-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies if needed (none required beyond Terraform).

---

### **Usage Examples**

#### **Example 1: Deploy Infrastructure**
Run the following command in your terminal to deploy the infrastructure:
```bash
cd terraform-deploy
terraform apply
```
This will create all required resources (VPC, ALB, ASG, EBS, etc.).

#### **Example 2: Access Load Balancer**
Once deployment completes, query the load balancer's IP address:
```bash
terraform output load_balancer_address
```
Use this address in your application to route traffic through the ALB.

---

### **Setup and Run Locally**
1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Assuming no dependencies except Terraform and providers.
   ```
3. **Apply the Configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

---

### **Contributing**
1. Fork the repository to your organization.
2. Make changes to the code files.
3. Submit a **Pull Request** (PR) for review.
4. Ensure all tests pass and the code adheres to the style guide.

### **License**
The project uses the [MIT License](LICENSE). View the full text in the LICENSE file.

**Note:** Replace `[USERNAME]` and other placeholders in the installation scripts with your actual values before use. Adjust variables in `variables.tf` and `terraform.tfvars` as per your project settings.
