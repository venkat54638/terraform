### Project Title  
Terraform-Based Application Load Balancer Solution  

---

### Description  
This project automates the creation of an Application Load Balancer (ALB) paired with auto-scaling groups and EBS volumes. It enables scalable, high-traffic applications by distributing incoming HTTP/S traffic across multiple backend servers within an Amazon VPC.  

---

### Features  
1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Manages HTTP/S traffic distribution.  
2. **Auto-Scaling Groups**: Ensures the number of servers scales up/down dynamically.  
3. **EBS Volume Management**: Provides persistent storage for application data.  
4. **Terraform Configuration**: Uses IaC best practices for reproducible deployments.  

---

### Prerequisites  
- **Terraform >= 1.0**: Install via Concourse, Packer, or directly (`brew install terraform`).
- **AWS Provider**: Ensure the `aws` provider is installed and configured with your credentials.
- **VPC and Subnets**: Have at least one VPC available; if not, modify the code to create one.

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/your-repo.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd your-repo  
   ```  

3. Initialize Terraform:  
   ```bash  
   terraform init  
   ```  

4. Apply the configuration:  
   ```bash  
   terraform apply --auto-approve  
   ```  

5. Verify resources exist:  
   ```bash  
   terraform list  
   ```  

---

### Usage  

#### Example 1: Deploy All Resources  
```bash  
# Run once to deploy the full stack  
 terraform apply  
```  
After execution, youâ€™ll see resources created. Outputs provided in `outputs.tf` include:  
- LoadBalancer DNS: `[value]`  
- VPC ID: `[value]`  

#### Example 2: Modify VPC Size  
Modify `main.tf` to adjust the number of subnets or VPC CIDR before applying.
