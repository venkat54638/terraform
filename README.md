# Project Title: My Terraform Configuration Repository

This repository contains a collection of Terraform configurations designed to create a scalable and secure infrastructure for web applications. The configurations cover various components like load balancers, auto-scaling groups, EBS volumes, and more. 

## Prerequisites
To use this project, you need to have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) installed and configured with your AWS credentials. Additionally, you'll need to set up a development environment that allows you to apply these configurations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository into your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-repo.git
   ```
2. Update your `~/.terraform/govectors` file with your custom vectors for different environments.
3. Create a new directory (`tfenv`) if it doesn't exist and initialize it:
   ```bash
   tfenv init .
   ```
4. Set up an alias for easier access:
   ```bash
   alias tf="tfenv --path /path/to/tfenv/bin/tf"
   ```

## Usage
### Example 1: Deploy a Basic Infrastructure
Here's how you can deploy the basic infrastructure:

1. Navigate to the deployment directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-infrastructure/deployments/basic
   ```
2. Apply the Terraform configurations:
   ```bash
   tf apply
   ```
3. Retrieve the VPC ID:
   ```bash
   vpc_id = output("vpc_id")
   ```

### Example 2: Scale Web Applications
You can scale your web applications using auto-scaling groups:

1. Modify the `variables.tf` to adjust the number of instances.
2. Re-run the `tf apply` command to apply the updated configurations.
