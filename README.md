## Project Title
This is the README for a GitHub repository containing various infrastructure as code (IAC) files written with Terraform. The project includes configurations for load balancing, auto-scaling, storage, and other resources.

---

## Description
The project provides a collection of Terraform templates to manage infrastructure resources. It includes configurations for setting up an application load balancer, configuring an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, managing an Auto Scaling group, deploying EC2 instances with user-data scripts, and creating a virtual private cloud (VPC). These templates are designed to be used together to build a fully functional serverless application.

---

## Prerequisites
To use this project, you need to have the following tools installed and configured:
1. **Terraform** (â‰¥1.0) to manage infrastructure as code.
2. **HashiCorp Ansible Inventory** or similar tool to handle resource configurations.
3. **Basic knowledge of Infrastructure as Code (IAC) principles**.

Additionally, the project assumes you're working within an existing AWS account where all necessary permissions are granted. Ensure that your IAM roles/permissions align with the operations required by the Terraform configurations.

---

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_USERNAME]/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Since this project uses `Terraform`, you'll need to ensure it's installed globally.  
   ```bash
   # Install Terraform if not already done
   curl -fsSL https://releases.hashic.org/tf/v1.7.x_ubuntu_x86_64.deb
   sudo dpkg -i tf
   ```

3. **Configure Variables**:  
   Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your project-specific parameters, such as region, project name, key pair, etc.

4. **Apply the Configuration**:  
   Run the following command to apply the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Optional - Test Outputs**:  
   After applying, check the generated resources' details:
   ```bash
   terraform show
   ```

---

## Usage
**Example 1: Deploy the Entire Infrastructure**
You can deploy all components by applying the `main` stack:
```bash
terraform apply
```
This will create resources as defined in `main.tf`, which includes the VPC, load balancer, EBS volumes, etc.

**Example 2: Update a Resource**
To modify a component, like updating the VPC CIDR, edit `variables.tf` and re-run:
```bash
terraform init; terraform apply
```

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this project, follow these steps:
1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   Forking allows you to make local changes without affecting the original project.
   
2. **Create a New Branch**:  
   When submitting a bug fix or feature, create a new branch based on the appropriate existing branch (e.g., `main`).

3. **Test Changes Locally**:  
   Before submitting a pull request, test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work with the current setup.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**:  
   Along with your implementation, provide a detailed explanation of what the change achieves.
