## Project Title

A Terraform-based solution to create an application load balancer with auto-scaling and EBS volumes.

---

## Description

This project provides a comprehensive infrastructure using HashiCorp's Terraform to deploy a scalable web application environment. The core components include an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic distribution, an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to manage instance counts dynamically, and EBS volumes for persistent storage. The solution ensures high availability and scalability by leveraging these resources effectively.

---

## Features

- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming HTTP/S traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Adjusts the number of running instances based on demand.
- **EBS Volumes:** Provides storage for static content and other data needs.
- **Terraform Configuration:** Uses best practices for IaC (Infrastructure as Code).
- **High Availability:** Ensures redundancy through proper resource placement.

---

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need the following:

1. A [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) account to utilize Terraform.
2. The [latest version of Terraform](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/index.html) installed locally.
3. Basic knowledge of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.
4. An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account if you plan to run the stack in production. (Note: This is optional during local testing but recommended for deployment.)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/project.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Ensure that `terraform` is installed globally or added to your PATH.  
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Apply the Stack:**  
   Run the following command to apply all resources:  
   ```bash
   terraform apply --auto-approve
   ```

   Note: Replace `user` and `projectname` with appropriate values before applying.

   Example variables can be set via `terraform tfvars` or environment variables.

## Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Deploy the Base Environment

```bash
# Apply the initial setup without additional options
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

#### Example 2: Customizing Instance Storage

```bash
# Increase EBS volume size and adjust scaling
terraform apply \
  -var="ebs_volume_size=20" \
  -var="max_size=5" 
```

## API Documentation

The generated resources expose the following endpoints:

| Resource | Endpoint          | Method |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| VPC      | /vpc             | GET    |
| ALB      | /load_balancer    | GET    |
| ASG      | /auto_scaling    | GET    |
